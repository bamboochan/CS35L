I did the lab with two other classmates. Kyrill and Theo.
We had two beaglebone boards(B1,B2). We each tried to log on to both.

----
We checked that we have open ssh installed already.
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

2
----
Setup server
ssh-keygen default location, no password
sudo useradd –d /home/theodir –m theo
sudo passwd 123
cd /home/theodir
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R theo .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh
ifconfig //remember the ip which was 192.232.123.61

Then the same for kyrill with kyrilldir and same password

Setup client(Theo's computer to my beaglebone)

ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id -i theo@192.232.123.61
ssh-add
ssh theo@192.232.123.61
We tried that you can ls mkdir touch cp now
exit
ssh theo@192.232.123.61
We tried firefox and xterm

We then used this similar procedure for Kyrill's computer to my Beaglebone and
my Beaglebone to Theo's Beaglebone. Everything works.
We then tried to connect from one beaglebone to another.
For X forwarding, we can open firefox after both beaglebone has firefox.
