2. Make the new branch

cd diffutils
git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'

3. Apply patch

patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

4 and 5. Run emacs C-x 4 a, and add the following message:

src/cmp.c, src/diff.c, src/diff3.c, src/dir.c, src/sdiff.c, src/util.c
Quote 'like this' in output.

6. Commit

git commit -aF ChangeLog

7. Generate the patch:

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. Get the patch from my partner and out it in ~/cs35l/devika/formatted-patch.txt

Partner's name: Devika Karumathil Chaudhuri
UID: 

Then go to the diffutils repository and checkout another branch:

git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

And apply the patch:

git am < ../devika/formatted-patch.txt

Now we compile:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

following all the auxiliary steps as outlined in the lab report.

9. We run

make distdir

which creates a directory diffutils-3.0.1-d793-dirty
after we cd into it, we emacs the ChangeLog file and observe that the first entry 
is our partner's log entry:

2018-03-16  Devika Karumathil Chaudhuri  <devika@lnxsrv04.seas.ucla.edu>

        2018-03-12 Devika Karumathil Chaudhuri <devika@lnxsrv04.seas.ucla.edu>
                * cmp.c:

                * util.c: added the patch quote-3.0-patch.txt

                * sdiff.c: added the patch quote-3.0-patch.txt

                * dir.c: added the patch quote-3.0-patch.txt

                * diff3.c: added the patch quote-3.0-patch.txt

                * diff.c: added the patch quote-3.0-patch.txt

                * cmp.c: added the patch quote-3.0-patch.txt
                

10. Clone the repository and run gitk in it:

First of all, I had to add /usr/local/cs/bin/ to PATH:

export PATH="/usr/local/cs/bin/:$PATH"

Now we can do the following:

git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
cd emacs
gitk
