Q1. Why did Brady's patch remove the line "case_long_iso_time_style:"? Was it necessary to remove that line? Explain.
case_long_iso_time_style is a marker for goto. It is called (and only called) in
decode_switches (int argc, char **argv)
                    formats.  If not, fall back on long-iso format.  */
                 int i;
                 for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
-                  {
-                    char const *locale_format =
-                      dcgettext (NULL, long_time_format[i], LC_TIME);
-                    if (locale_format == long_time_format[i])
-                      goto case_long_iso_time_style;
-                    long_time_format[i] = locale_format;
-                  }
+                  long_time_format[i] =
+                    dcgettext (NULL, long_time_format[i], LC_TIME);
               }
      Before the patch,  when a locale does not have a specific format translation, i.e. dcgettect doesn't change long_time_format[i], the format is set to "long-iso" format. Which is what happened with the en_* locales for example.Since the part that actually sets in default in docode_switches is deleted already and that goto case is not called anywhere else, it is not super necessary to remove it.

Q2. If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils instead of the default one, what else should you watch out for? Might this new version of Coreutils introduce other problems with your application, perhaps in countries where users don't speak English and don't understand English-format dates?
If another language not English also does not specify format translation, it would be a problem because the format now is defaulted to POSIX-long-iso format which label months in English.

Q3. It will go into an index error because it cannot select one line. seq in empty so no matter what the ramdom number generated is, there is no such element in the array.Error message:
return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range
Q4.running it in python3 gives a syntax error because python3 and python2.7 use different syntax sometimes
