1. Get the diffutils repository

git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2. Get the log of changes 

git log > git-log.txt

3. Get the list of tags

git tag > git-tags.txt

4. Use the Emacs 'C-s' command to find “maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'”
in git-log.txt. The SHA1 for this commit was 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f.
Then generate the patch:

git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f --stdout > quote-patch.txt

5. Check out version 3.0

git checkout v3.0

6. Apply the patch

patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

9. For the non-c files, aka NEWS, README, TODO, doc/diagmeet.note, ms/config.bat,
ms/config.site, po/en.po, src/diff.h, src/system.h, tests/help-version
use the emacs command vc-revert to revert the changes.

For the c files, which were 

analyze.c, cmp.c, context.c,
diff.c, diff3.c, dir.c, ifdef.c, io.c, sdiff.c,
side.c, util.c 

we go through enter the diff mode in Emacs using 'C-x v =', and then 
go through the patches with 'n' and revert the necessary ones with 'C-u C-c C-a'

10. We have to apply some more changes manually to diff.c and diff3.c. 
We do that using the emacs 'C-s' search command looking at the .rej file.

11. To remove untracted files, do

git clean -f

12. 'git status' reports 6 modified files:

	# HEAD detached at v3.0
	# Changes not staged for commit:
	#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	#
	#	modified:   src/cmp.c
	#	modified:   src/diff.c
	#	modified:   src/diff3.c
	#	modified:   src/dir.c
	#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
	#	modified:   src/util.c
	#
	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
	
We then generate the new patch:

git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. First we switch to lnxsrv01 so we don't have to apply the additional patch. 
Them we add the relevant executables to the PATH:

export PATH="/usr/local/cs/bin/:$PATH"

Then we follows the README-hacking file:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

Initially the 'make check' step gave me the following error:

	/bin/sh: /bin/sh: cannot execute binary file
	Makefile:1309: recipe for target 'basic.log' failed
	make[3]: *** [basic.log] Error 126
	make[3]: Leaving directory '/w/home.18/class/classmsu/cs35l/diffutils/tests'
	Makefile:1288: recipe for target 'check-TESTS' failed
	make[2]: *** [check-TESTS] Error 2
	make[2]: Leaving directory '/w/home.18/class/classmsu/cs35l/diffutils/tests'
	Makefile:1403: recipe for target 'check-am' failed
	make[1]: *** [check-am] Error 2
	make[1]: Leaving directory '/w/home.18/class/classmsu/cs35l/diffutils/tests'
	Makefile:1016: recipe for target 'check-recursive' failed
	make: *** [check-recursive] Error 1
	
As suggested in a piazza post, if was fixed by changing the line

-; shell_or_perl_
+;

in the file tests/Makefile.am and then running 

chmod +x tests/binary tests/no-newline-at-eof

After this I re-ran the commands from README-hacking, and they succeeded.
Then we check the patch:

cd src
diff . -

	Output:
	diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

diff --help

						M  L+1
				%(A=B?T:E)  if A equals B then T else E

				%[-][WIDTH][.[PREC]]{doxX}n  printf-style spec for input line number
			Both GFMT and LFMT may contain:
				%%  %
				%c'C'  the single character C
				%c'\OOO'  the character with octal code OOO

	FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.
	If --from-file or --to-file is given, there are no restrictions on FILE(s).
	If a FILE is '-', read standard input.
	Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

We see that the issue is successfully fixed.

14. Set up the two versions of diff:


cp ./src/* ../diffutils-3.0-patch/
cd ..
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutils-orig
cd diffutils-orig
git checkout v3.0
mkdir ../diffutils-3.0
cp ./src/* ../diffutils-3.0
cd ..

Then run our new diff:

diffutils-3.0-patch/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt


15. Run 

diff quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt

We see a lot of differences, but they are related to the file paths, 
line length and the order in which files are compared: it seems like the order in
which diff.c and diff3.c are compared is switched. We conclude that the differences
are innocuous.
