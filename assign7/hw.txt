After the authentification stage, all the information sent between the client
is encypted by the symmetric session key. So if a third person want to
understand those messages, he has to know the session key. He can only get the
session key during authentification stage. The session key is sent from the 
client to the server after encrypted with the public key of the client. Even
the snooper can view it, he cannot decrypt it without the client's private key.
So the data is secure.

(1)If the other teams had also tapped your keyboards and had observed all of 
your team's keystrokes, then the information will not be secure any more. 
Everytime when you ssh (or when you ssh-add if you are using ssh-agent), you 
need to enter the passphrase. If the snooper knows the passphrase, he could
know the private key of the client, thus decrypt the session key, thus decrypt everything.

(2)If the other teams temporarily had physical control of the USB, the session
will not be secure because the snooper will have full access to the private 
and public key in the .ssh files as the root, thus being able to decipher 
all the information exchanged.

It is not really secure because a snooper can intercept the message and send
his public key instead along with the file encrypted in his encryption. Then 
gpg --verify will still pass because the file and the signature does match.
One way to fix it is that the author can publish the public key and signature
on the internet publicly. Then everyone downloading it can verify the author.
